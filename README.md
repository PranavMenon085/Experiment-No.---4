Experiment No.4
Aim of the experiment : Study of Set in Python
Theory : The following topics were covered during the Lecture :
1) Introduction to Set - (A Set is a Collection of DataSet . When Printing a Set , the index of the elements belonging to the set are randomly Displayed . This inturn creates an ambiguity regarding the Indexing of an Element in a Set . However , unlike Tuple , elements can be Inserted or Removed from a Set whenever Required.)
2)  Duplication of Sets are Not Allowed
3)  Logical Command Application in Set - (A set Considers "1" as "True" , "0" as "False" and vise - versa)
4)  To check for the membership in a Set - ( "Name" in Set i.e "banana" in thisset)
5)  Addition of an element in a set - ("setname.add("Element")" i.e thisset.add("Orange"))
6)  Removal of an element from a set - ("setname.remove("Element")" i.e thisset.remove("Orange"))
7)  Operations on a set - (Union of a Set (A | B) , Intersection of a Set(A & B) , Difference of Elements in Sets(A - B or B - A) , Symmetric Difference(A ^ B))
8)  Introduction to FrozenSet - (Frozenset is a Set which is immutable i.e cannot be edited once created)
9)   Practice Problems on Set - Conversion of List To a Set (set(List_Name) i.e set(list1))
10)  Practice Problems on Set - (Intersection of a Set(A & B),Difference of Elements in Sets(A - B or B - A) , Symmetric Difference(A ^ B))
11)  Practice Problems on Set - (Union of a Set (A | B) , Intersection of a Set(A & B) , Difference of Elements in Sets(A - B or B - A) , Symmetric Difference(A ^ B))
12)  Practice Problems on Set - Difference of Elements in Sets(A - B or B - A)
13)  Practice Problems on Set - (discard() and remove())
    Difference between discard and remove in Python :
1) Discard()
   - Removes the element
   - No error Raised
2) Remove()
   - Removes the element
   - Raises KeyError
  
Algorithm : 
1) To remove the Names of Repeated Names of Students from List :
- Enter the Data (mark list)
- Read the list
- Perform -
